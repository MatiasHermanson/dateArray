# dateArray

MyDate.java has to be in the same package as DateArray.java in order for this to work correctly. There are 4 date arrays in DateArray.java that can be changed in order
to get different outputs. Because MyDate.java takes in a string, int, and int that is the order that you must enter the arguments or else you will get a compiling error.
If you would like to change the order of the arguments go into MyDate.java and change the arguments as they are listed in the MyDate method. 
The output to the console will be each date on its own line with a comma between the date and the year.
